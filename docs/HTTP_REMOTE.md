# Remote HTTP-Based Transcription

Vocalinux can offload speech recognition to a remote HTTP server instead of running a local model. This is useful when you want faster transcription on a more powerful machine, want to share one model across several clients, or want to keep your laptop free of GPU/model overhead.

Vocalinux speaks two wire formats out of the box:

- **OpenAI-compatible** — `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` (e.g. OpenAI, [Speaches](https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches), LocalAI, vLLM with Whisper)
- **whisper.cpp server** — `POST /inference` (the binary shipped with [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp))

Pick whichever your server exposes — the rest of this guide applies to both.

> **Tip — share the server with your phone.** Both formats are open standards, so the same self-hosted server can also back mobile dictation apps. On Android, apps like *Dictate* and *Transcribro* speak OpenAI-compatible Whisper; on iOS, Shortcuts-based dictation clients can hit the same endpoint. Run one Whisper server, point your laptop and phone at it, and you get consistent dictation everywhere without uploading audio to a third party.

## How It Works

When the **Remote API** engine is active, Vocalinux:

1. Captures microphone audio locally (16 kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM).
2. On end-of-utterance, packages the buffer as a WAV file in memory.
3. Uploads it via `multipart/form-data` to the configured server.
4. Reads the transcribed text from the JSON response (`{"text": "..."}`) and types it into the focused window.

No audio is ever written to disk. The local machine still runs the VAD/segmentation logic — only the heavy ASR step is remote.

## Server-Side Setup

You need a server that accepts audio uploads and returns `{"text": "..."}`. Two common options:

### Option A: whisper.cpp server

Build and run the bundled HTTP server from the [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp
cd whisper.cpp
make server
./models/download-ggml-model.sh medium.en
./build/bin/whisper-server \
    --model models/ggml-medium.en.bin \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8080
```

The server now listens on `http://<server-ip>:8080`. The endpoint is `/inference`.

### Option B: OpenAI-compatible server (Speaches, LocalAI, etc.)

Run any server that implements `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`. Example with [Speaches](https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches):

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/speaches-ai/speaches:latest
```

The endpoint is `/v1/audio/transcriptions`.

### Network checklist

- The server must be reachable from the client over HTTP or HTTPS.
- If you bind to `0.0.0.0`, open the port in your firewall (`ufw allow 8080/tcp`, etc.).
- For anything outside a trusted LAN, terminate TLS in front of the server (Caddy, nginx, Traefik) and require an API key — the audio you upload is private speech.
- If you plan to also use the server from a mobile dictation app, terminate TLS even on a LAN — most Android and iOS apps refuse cleartext HTTP regardless of network.

## Client-Side Setup (Vocalinux)

### Via the Settings dialog

The remote engine is a power-user override and lives on the **Advanced** tab so casual users aren't confronted with it.

1. Launch Vocalinux and open **Settings → Advanced → Remote Server**.
2. Toggle **Use remote server** on. This overrides whatever local engine is selected on the Speech Engine tab.
3. Fill in the fields:
   - **Server URL**: base URL of the server, e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:8080` (no trailing slash needed; one is stripped automatically).
   - **API Key** (optional): sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Leave blank if your server doesn't require auth.
   - **API Endpoint**: pick **Whisper.cpp (`/inference`)** or **OpenAI (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`)** to match your server.
4. Click **Test Connection** — a successful test means the URL is reachable and credentials (if any) are accepted. A failure here is just a warning; Vocalinux will still try again on the first transcription.

Settings auto-save and re-initialise the engine immediately, so you can start dictating as soon as the test passes. Toggling the switch off restores the local engine selected on the Speech Engine tab.

### Via the config file

The same options live in `~/.config/vocalinux/config.json`:

```json
{
  "speech_recognition": {
    "engine": "remote_api",
    "remote_api_url": "http://192.168.1.100:8080",
    "remote_api_key": "",
    "remote_api_endpoint": "/inference"
  }
}
```

Restart Vocalinux after editing the file by hand.

## Wire Protocol Reference

If you're writing a custom server, here's exactly what the client sends.

### Request — whisper.cpp format (`/inference`)

```
POST {server_url}/inference HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>          # only if configured
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=...

--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="audio.wav"
Content-Type: audio/wav

<WAV bytes: 16 kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM>
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="temperature"

0.0
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="temperature_inc"

0.2
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="response_format"

json
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="language"

en
--boundary--
```

### Request — OpenAI-compatible format (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`)

```
POST {server_url}/v1/audio/transcriptions HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=...

--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="audio.wav"
Content-Type: audio/wav

<WAV bytes>
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="model"

whisper-1
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="language"

en
--boundary--
```

### Response (both formats)

```json
{ "text": "the transcribed utterance" }
```

Empty utterances should return `{"text": ""}`. HTTP 4xx/5xx responses are surfaced as transcription errors in the Vocalinux log.

### Language handling

- Vocalinux's UI language `auto` is sent as **no `language` field** (server auto-detects).
- `en-us` is normalised to `en`.
- Anything else is forwarded verbatim.

### Timeouts

- Connection test: **5 s**
- Transcription request: **30 s**

A request that exceeds the transcription timeout is logged and dropped; the next utterance is sent fresh.

## Verifying with `curl`

Quick sanity check without launching the GUI:

```bash
# Whisper.cpp server
curl -F file=@sample.wav \
     -F temperature=0.0 \
     -F response_format=json \
     http://192.168.1.100:8080/inference

# OpenAI-compatible
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
     -F file=@sample.wav \
     -F model=whisper-1 \
     http://192.168.1.100:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions
```

Both should return JSON with a `text` field.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Connection test reports "failed" | Wrong host/port, firewall, or server not running | Check `curl <url>` from the client; check server logs |
| HTTP 401/403 | API key missing or wrong | Set the **API Key** field; ensure the server is configured for that key |
| HTTP 404 on first send | Endpoint format mismatch | Switch the **API Endpoint** dropdown to the format your server actually exposes |
| Transcription always empty | Server rejected the WAV (sample rate, channels) | Confirm server accepts 16 kHz mono 16-bit WAV; check server logs |
| First transcription is slow | Cold model load on the server | Warm the server before dictating, or increase the client timeout server-side |
| Garbled text in foreign language | Wrong `language` setting | Set the language explicitly in Settings instead of `auto` |

Logs live at `~/.local/share/vocalinux/vocalinux.log` (or wherever your `XDG_DATA_HOME` points). Look for lines tagged `Remote API` for client-side detail.

## Security Notes

- The API key is stored in plain JSON in `~/.config/vocalinux/config.json`. Treat that file the same way you treat any other secret on disk.
- Audio is sent as raw WAV — anyone on the wire can hear it. Use HTTPS for any deployment outside a fully trusted network.
- Vocalinux does **not** validate TLS certificate pins; standard system trust is used. Self-signed certs require importing the CA into your system trust store.
